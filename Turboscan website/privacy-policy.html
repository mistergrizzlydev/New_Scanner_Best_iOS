<p>When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to such data.</p>
<p>It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status.</p>
<p>Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”).</p>
<p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED, CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU USE THE APP YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>
<p><strong>2. INFORMATION WE PROCESS</strong></p>

<p>2.2 Information That Is Processed Automatically</p>
<p>When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We process this information on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services and features of the App.</p>
<p>Information related to your device. When you use a mobile device (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, we may monitor one or more “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.</p>

When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.</p>
<p>The App may use automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements. Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically when you start using the App.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, scripts to process information about how you use our App and provide features to you. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to our server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access a specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.</p>
<p><strong>3. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to constantly improve our App and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission, we use your information for the following purposes:</p>
<p>(a) To make our service available. We use information that you submit and information that is processed automatically to provide you with all requested services.</p>
<p>(b) To improve, test and monitor the effectiveness of our App. We use information that is processed automatically to better understand user behavior and trends, detect potential outages and technical issues, to operate, protect, improve, and optimize our App.</p>
<p>(c) To provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content. We may use information that is processed automatically for marketing purposes (to show ads that may be of interest to you based on your preferences). We provide personalized content and information to you, which can include online ads or other forms of marketing.</p>

We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>
<p>(e) To prevent fraud and spam, to enforce the law. We really want our App to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free. We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If any new purposes for processing your personal data arise we will let you know we start to process information on that other purpose by introducing the corresponding changes to this Privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>4. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not share your information with any third party.</p>
<p><strong>5. HOW LONG WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for performing the functional service of the App and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information that we physically access and store, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account.</p>
<p>However, some data may still be stored for a certain time period (but no longer than the storage purpose requires) if information is necessary to comply with legal obligation (taxation, accounting, audit) or in order to maintain safety and data backup settings, prevent fraud or other malicious acts.</p>
<p><strong>6. SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is highly important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>
<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information.</p>
<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimization, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing. We seek your personal data to be encrypted with proper and strong encryption algorithms, including hashing where possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We do our best to protect your personal data, nevertheless, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the event that your personal information is compromised as a breach of security, we will promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security of our App, you can contact us at through email or contact form displayed below.</p>
<p><strong>7. How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We strive to protect you from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we have taken steps to protect your information, we do not guarantee (and should not expect) that your personal information is always safe.</p>
<p>We regularly monitor vulnerabilities and attacks in our systems and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>
<p>If we suspect or discover any breach of security, we may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice. If you believe your information is no longer secure, please contact us by email at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>8. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy policy will be regularly updated.</p>
<p>Whenever we change this Privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy policy and other places that we consider appropriate. Additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances may be provided to you.</p>
